Following this answer in case you want to do this manually (i.e. not using git init --separate-git-dir). I'll assume that in the directory D:\projectfolder there are your files and a .git folder. You want to move that folder to D:\gitfolder

In D:\projectfolder create a file (not folder) named .git with this content:

gitdir: D:\gitfolder\.git
In folder D:\gitfolder\.git edit the config file with this line under [core]:

worktree = D:\projectfolder
You can also do this with this command git config core.worktree D:\projectfolder.



***********  Michael's Implementation ************
Project folder:  D:\Users\Michael\My Drive\Sebsite
Desired .git folder location folder: D:\Users\Michael\Documents\GitFolder

In "D:\Users\Michael\My Drive\Sebsite" create a file (not folder) named .git with this content:
gitdir: D:\Users\Michael\Documents\GitFolder\.git

In folder "D:\Users\Michael\Documents\GitFolder\.git" edit the config file with this line under [core]:
worktree = D:\Users\Michael\My Drive\Sebsite
